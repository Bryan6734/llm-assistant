Spend no more than 2 hours on making a LLM command line helper. This will be a script that you can launch in your terminal that will ask you for something you’d like to achomplish on your shell (like commit code to GitHub, starting a Redis server, looking for a particular file, etc…) The llm will them suggest a bash command to run and you can accept it or reject it. Bonus points if you add a feature where the LLM can code for a while without your permission.
